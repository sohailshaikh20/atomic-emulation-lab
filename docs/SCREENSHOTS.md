# Screenshots to add (for recruiters)

Add these images to `docs/images/` (redact usernames/IPs if needed):
1) Evidence folder tree (show meta.json + manifest.sha256)
2) Sysmon Event ID 1 showing CommandLine and Hashes
3) detection_summary.json open in editor
4) One terminal run showing RUN_ID creation

Then reference them in README under a "Screenshots" section.
